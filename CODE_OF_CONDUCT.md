#Code of Conduct under the Contributor Covenant

## Our Promise

Regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation, we as contributors and maintainers commit to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Principles

Examples of conduct that helps to foster a favorable environment include:

* Speaking in a warm and inclusive manner;
* Respecting others' experiences and points of view;
* Graciously taking criticism; putting the community's needs first; 
* Empathetically relating to other community members.


Examples of participant behavior that is inappropriate include:

* Trolling, offensive/derogatory remarks, and political or personal assaults 
* The use of sexualized language or images and unwanted sexual attention or approaches
* Harassment, whether it be in public or privately 
* Publishing someone else's private information without their consent 
* Other actions that can be considered unprofessional in a work environment

We All Have Responsibilities

The rules of acceptable behavior must be made clear by project maintainers, who are also expected to respond to any instances of improper behavior with appropriate and just corrective action.

The right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not adhere to this Code of Conduct is reserved for project maintainers. They also have the right to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other actions they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

When a person is representing a project or its community, the code of conduct is in effect both inside project spaces and in public areas. Using an official project email address, publishing via an official social media account, or serving as a designated representative at an offline or online event are a few examples of representing a project or community. Project maintainers may provide additional definitions and clarifications on project representation.

## Police Action

You can report instances of abusive, harassing, or other undesirable behavior by sending an email to info@adrestus.net on behalf of the project team. Every complaint will be examined, looked into, and given the response(s) that are judged necessary and fitting for the situation. The project team has a duty of care to protect the identity of the incident reporter.
Additional information about certain enforcement procedures may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who violate the Code of Conduct in good faith may suffer short-term or long-term consequences as decided by other leadership members of the project.
