# This file contains K' values for which an optimized decoder is available.

# Each K' value must be defined in a new line.
# Empty lines and lines that begin with a # are ignored by the parser. Since the
# maximum K' is 56403, lines that have more than 5 characters are also ignored.
# Finally, unknown values of K' are ignored as well.

# An implementation of an optimized decoder is realized if there exists a file
# with a name with the following format: "ISD_{K'}.dat" with {K'} substituted by
# the K' value supported by the implementation.
